Internet Button Mini Hack
===
Welcome to the Internet Button Hack. This simple hack will introduce you to Azure Event Bus which will allow you to easily receive messages from a Particle Internet Button or any lower level device. 

By completing this hack you will have a Azure Event Bus that will receive messages from the SimonSays game interactions. The mobile application will also publish events that can be received through the Event Bus.



Sounds amazing, doesn't it?  We think so too!  

We think you'll be able to complete this mini hack in 20 minutes.  If you get stuck or have any questions, no problem.  Head over to the Twilio booth and we'll be happy to walk through some code with you.

Alright.  With the intro out of the way, letâ€™s get building!

### Mini Hack Requirements ###

Developers will need to setup a Particle account to interact with devices and setup the underlying framework for messages. The mobile application is already built with Xamarin.Forms and supports iOS, Android and UWP. If you would like to check out the source code, it will be made available in the near future. 

Getting Started
===
To get started you'll need to create an Azure account if you don't already have one. Head over to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) to setup a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/). 

You will also need to create a Particle account. Don't worry, it's is completely free to [signup](https://build.particle.io/signup). You can also create an account through the mobile application if you don't want to interact with the Particle website. Once you have signed up, make sure to write down your username and password because we will need it soon. 

Next we need to install the Particle command line tools. We will use this to create the webhook that will send messages to our Azure Event Bus.
